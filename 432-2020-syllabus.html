<div id="course-description" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Course Description</h1>
<p>PQHS 432 (cross-listed as CRSP 432 and MPHP 432, and formerly known as EPBI 432) is the second half of a two-semester sequence (with PQHS 431) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent (as little theory as possible), emphasizing the key role of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research. The title listed by the registrar is a little dated - I prefer <em>Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research</em>.</p>
<p>This is a good course for people who want to learn how to use the R language to get information from data, and who want to learn about making comparisons and building models to help make meaningful progress in research, focusing on questions from biology, medicine and public health. We spend time managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other things thought of as “data science” - in essence, this highly applied course focuses on modern, more than classical, tools for learning from data. The course is taught using the R statistical software and RStudio environments, with the material discussed in 431 assumed in 432. Students learned a lot of R in the 431 course, and that material remains available at <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431" class="uri">https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431</a>. We’ll continue to use R Studio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform our research in replicable ways.</p>
<div id="general-approach-topics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> General Approach / Topics</h2>
<p>The course covers the following general topics, roughly in this order, through early April. Additional topics (for the remainder of April) will be determined later in the semester.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Linear Regression (including weighted and robust approaches, variable selection, dealing with missing data, fitting non-linear relationships through predictor transformation, cross-validation approaches, and multi-factor ANOVA and ANCOVA)</li>
<li>Logistic Regression (including both models for binary outcomes, and models for proportions, and risk adjustment)</li>
<li>Generalized Linear Models (including regression models for count data, multi-categorical outcomes)</li>
<li>The Statistical Crisis in Science</li>
<li>Cluster Analysis (mostly in the form of Principal Components Analysis)</li>
<li>Survival Analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox Regression)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Taking 432 without 431 is not recommended. The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, in any field of study.</p>
<p>The main things students need for 432 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tools: substantive knowledge of the use of R, R Studio and R Markdown to produce code which will ingest, visualize, explore, analyze and model data, then communicate the results</li>
<li>statistical methodology: substantive understanding of statistical inference in the one-, two- and multi-sample cases and the fundamentals of linear regression models, including the building of multiple linear regressions, and their evaluation through diagnostic plots, stepwise model selection, assessment of uncertainty via confidence and prediction intervals, and basic in-sample and out-of sample validation summaries</li>
<li>data to study related to biological, health, medical, scientific or other phenomena, and</li>
<li>an interest in studying data closely and presenting rigorous analyses effectively</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these topics are reviewed in early 432 sessions.</p>
</div>
<div id="everything-is-on-the-web" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Everything is on the Web</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432" class="uri">https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432</a> is the place to go for everything related to this course. Please visit any time you need something. I update the web site frequently.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most important thing is the <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/calendar.md">Course Calendar</a> which serves as the final word for all deadlines, plus links to all classes and deliverables.</li>
<li>Dr. Love’s <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/">book of 432 Course Notes</a> is the principal textbook for the course, and will appear during the semester. The <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-432-book/">Spring 2019 version</a> is available now.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Before our First Class</h2>
<p>Most of you have already accessed <a href="https://431-2020-preclass-love.netlify.app/">the pre-class website</a>. Once class begins, that will no longer be relevant, and will be replaced by <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/">our main course website</a> and (among other things) this Syllabus. If you’re seeing this before class starts on 2020-08-25, then make sure that you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Register and enroll in the course via the <a href="https://sis.case.edu/">CWRU Student Information System (SIS)</a>.
<ul>
<li>Note that PQHS 431, CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 are all identical.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Review <a href="https://431-2020-preclass-love.netlify.app/">the pre-class website</a> and this syllabus. The most important needs initially are learning [about the books][Required Texts] you’ll need to purchase, and [the software][Getting the Software] you’ll need to install.</li>
<li>Review <a href="https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information">CWRU’s Knowledge Base for Zoom</a> to ensure you can join our first class through your CWRU Zoom account. Watch your CWRU email for further bulletins (including the Zoom links for the first few class sessions which will be posted on 2020-08-24.)</li>

</div>
<div id="what-do-i-need-to-buy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> What Do I Need To Buy?</h2>
<p>We’ll read two books that you need to purchase (combined price is $18 to $33):</p>
<ul>

</div>
<div id="welcome-to-431-survey" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> “Welcome to 431” Survey</h2>
<p>Most of you did this before class started, but if you haven’t, please fill out the <a href="https://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-survey">Welcome to 431 Survey</a> at <a href="https://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-survey" class="uri">https://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-survey</a> to help us get to know you a little better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that you must <strong>log into Google via your CWRU account</strong> in order to access the survey.</li>
<li>The survey should take 15-20 minutes to complete, and we encourage you to complete it as soon as you can.</li>

<p>The CWRU Return to Campus website is found at <a href="https://case.edu/return-to-campus/" class="uri">https://case.edu/return-to-campus/</a>.</p>
<p>Life is not OK right now. None of us are really okay. We’re all just pretending.</p>
<p>You most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased care responsibilities - you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you might be facing uncertain job prospects.</p>
<p>I’m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your labs, do well on your quizzes and projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am fairly flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified. If you tell me you’re having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace.</p>
<p>You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through, though. If I can’t help you myself, I may know somebody who can.</p>
<p>If you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you’re behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to us! We will work with you. I promise.</p>
<p>I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> IN CASE OF EMERGENCY</h3>
<p>If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of work that has a deadline, like a lab, minute paper, or the like, send an email directly to Dr. Love saying the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (<em>list things you’re worried about completing</em>) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Love will respond with “OK” and temporarily excuse you from things until <strong>you</strong> send a “re-connection” email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time he’ll evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency.</li>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Getting Help with 432</h1>
<p>Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of frustration (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!). <strong>You shouldn’t spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help.</strong></p>
<p>Once the course begins, you have several ways to get help from us:</p>
<div id="piazza-is-the-place-to-ask-questions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Piazza is the place to ask questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>We will use <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a> this semester to facilitate questions and answers. We’ll be conducting all class-related discussion there, instead of via email.</li>
<li>Find our class page at: <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431/home" class="uri">https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431/home</a>. If you’re successfully enrolled in the class, you should be able to sign up immediately.
<ul>
<li>The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you’ll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors.</li>
<li>We encourage you to ask questions when you’re struggling to understand anything related to the class, and you can even do so anonymously.</li>
<li>You’ll also be able to help your colleagues by answering their questions, as well.</li>
<li>We will use Piazza for all questions <strong>except</strong> questions about <a href="#quizzes">Quizzes</a>. Details on the plan for Quizzes follow in the <a href="#quizzes">Quizzes section</a> below.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are many, many online resources to help you learn R beyond those we provide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Googling effectively is an important skill that requires practice. Don’t be afraid to use search engines to figure out how to code things in R, for example.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio Community</a> is a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (and that will be you.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="virtual-ta-office-hours-provide-one-on-one-help" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Virtual TA Office hours provide one-on-one help</h2>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to visit TAs during office hours that are convenient for you, whenever you need help with the course. This is the best way to get one-on-one help, or try out a new idea.
- Teaching Assistant (TA) office hours will be held via Zoom, beginning 2020-08-31.
- A schedule is now available on Canvas (in the Announcements folder.)
- Office Hours are held for your benefit. Please visit the TAs, especially if you have questions about how to do things in R, or about the content of the class slides or course notes. They’re volunteering their time to help you, and most of them have been in your shoes in previous years. They want to help you!

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> A More Complete Biography</h2>
<p>Hi. I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics.</li>
<li>I direct <a href="http://chrp.org/biostatistics-evaluation/">Biostatistics and Evaluation</a> at the <a href="http://chrp.org/">Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy</a>, which is a joint venture of CWRU and MetroHealth Medical Center.</li>
<li>For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for <a href="http://betterhealthpartnership.org/">Better Health Partnership</a>, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there.</li>
<li>I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 <a href="https://students.case.edu/traditions/awards/diekhoff/">John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching</a> from CWRU.</li>
<li>I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management.</li>
</ul>
<p>In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may be interested in a <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/7/1121.abstract">recent study in Health Affairs</a> showing the impact of a <a href="http://thedaily.case.edu/new-study-shows-prepared-safety-net-improves-care-saves-money-in-medicaid-expansion-population/">Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland</a>.</li>

<li>In 2011, <a href="http://tdi.dartmouth.edu/faculty/a-james-omalley-phd">James O’Malley</a> and I chaired the <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ichps/2011/index.cfm?fuseaction=main">Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics</a>, here in Cleveland. Here’s a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10742-012-0096-8">recap</a>.</li>
<li>I’ve also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to see a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/thomas.love.1/bibliography/public/">pretty complete list of my publications</a>, knock yourself out.</p>
<p>I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at GE Lighting, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder is a junior in college (University of Pittsburgh) who plans to be a paleontologist, and one finishing high school this year, who will attend Columbia this Fall. I live in Shaker Heights. I also sing and act occasionally in <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater">community theater</a>.</p>

<div id="a-few-writingpresenting-tips" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> A Few Writing/Presenting Tips</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Statistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t parrot back material that Dr. Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in other words is, technically, plagiarism.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results.</p></li>
<li><p>Make your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate.</p></li>
<li><p>Simplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well.</p></li>
<li><p>Data are plural. Use “the data <strong>are</strong> …” rather than ``the data <em>is</em> … ’’</p></li>
<li><p>A paragraph must contain more than one sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to write that you used <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re looking at a <em>p</em>-value, then you should state either:</p>
<ul>
<li>[1] We’re using a 95% confidence level.<br />
</li>
<li>[2] We’re using a 5% significance level. or</li>
<li>[3] We’re using <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>.<br />
</li>
<li>Don’t use more than one of these expressions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Refer to all <em>p</em>-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.001\)</span>, rather than, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.00000001\)</span> or, worse yet, <span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span>. In a similar vein, write all <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values that exceed 0.99 as <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.99\)</span> instead of, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(p = 1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, don’t use <code>computer-ese</code> to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Use words that we all know, whenever possible, and provide clear definitions at the first encounter when jargon is mandatory.</p></li>
<li><p>Often the most useful thing you can do in an analysis is to turn a table into a meaningful graph.</p></li>
<li><p>When in doubt, err on the side of clearer expression. Clear thinking causes and is demonstrated by clear writing.</p></li>
<li><p>In the words of <a href="https://twitter.com/kjspin7/status/886006382993915904">Edward Tufte</a>, to think clearly, keep asking yourself …</p></li>
