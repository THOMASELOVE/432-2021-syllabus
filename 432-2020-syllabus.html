<p>The CWRU Return to Campus website is found at <a href="https://case.edu/return-to-campus/" class="uri">https://case.edu/return-to-campus/</a>.</p>
<p>Life is not OK right now. None of us are really okay. We’re all just pretending.</p>
<p>You most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased care responsibilities - you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you might be facing uncertain job prospects.</p>
<p>I’m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your labs, do well on your quizzes and projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am fairly flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified. If you tell me you’re having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace.</p>
<p>You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through, though. If I can’t help you myself, I may know somebody who can.</p>
<p>If you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you’re behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to us! We will work with you. I promise.</p>
<p>I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://econf20.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus/#learning-during-a-pandemic">Andrew Heiss</a> for a lot of the better words here.</p>

<h2 number="1.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> In case of emergency</h2>
<p>What if my situation changes (for any reason) during the semester?</p>
<p>If you need to miss one session, or even two, just review the materials (including the recordings) and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help.</p>
<p>If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of a lab, a project or a quiz, send an email directly to Dr. Love saying the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (<em>list things you’re worried about completing</em>) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Love will respond with “OK” and temporarily excuse you from things until <strong>you</strong> send a “re-connection” email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time he’ll evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency.</li>

<div id="course-description" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1 number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Course Description</h1>
<p>PQHS 432 (cross-listed as CRSP 432 and MPHP 432, and formerly known as EPBI 432) is the second half of a two-semester sequence (with PQHS 431) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent (as little theory as possible), emphasizing the key role of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research. The title listed by the registrar is a little dated - I prefer <em>Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research</em>.</p>
<p>This is a good course for people who want to learn how to use the R language to get information from data, and who want to learn about making comparisons and building models to help make meaningful progress in research, focusing on questions from biology, medicine and public health. We spend time managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other things thought of as “data science” - in essence, this highly applied course focuses on modern, more than classical, tools for learning from data. The course is taught using the R statistical software and RStudio environments, with the material discussed in 431 assumed in 432. Students learned a lot of R in the 431 course, and that material remains available at <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/" class="uri">https://thomaselove.github.io/431/</a> until June 2021. We’ll continue to use R Studio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform our research in replicable ways.</p>
<div id="general-approach-topics" class="section level2" number="3.1">
<h2 number="3.1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> General Approach / Topics</h2>
<p>The course covers the following general topics, roughly in this order, through early April. Additional topics (for the remainder of April) will be determined later in the semester.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Dealing with interaction and other forms of non-linearity in regression models by spending degrees of freedom on non-linear terms, particularly through the <a href="https://www.nicholas-ollberding.com/post/an-introduction-to-the-harrell-verse-predictive-modeling-using-the-hmisc-and-rms-packages/">Harrell “verse”</a>.</li>
<li>Using regression methods for different purposes (exploring associations, making predictions, assessing cause and effect).</li>
<li>Logistic regression and generalized linear models for binary, count and multi-categorical outcomes.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/">tidymodels</a> approaches to build models in a more automated, tidier way, and to use more modern (robust and/or Bayesian) regression fitting strategies.</li>
<li>Variable selection and its woeful performance in real situations.</li>
<li>The statistical crisis in science, and how though statistical significance and p values are especially problematic, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/">science isn’t broken</a>.</li>
<li>Retrospective assessments and issues related to sample size, especially post hoc power estimates.</li>
<li>Dealing with time-to-event (survival) data, with an introduction to censoring, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models.</li>
<li>Using sampling weights to mirror populations in modeling results (NHANES being a prime example).</li>
<li>An introduction to dealing with hierarchical data, especially when confronted with repeated measures.</li>
<li>Doing replicable research, and how to be a modern scientist with a web presence.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the realm of modeling, our linear regression work will include discussions of weighted and robust approaches, variable selection, dealing with missing data, fitting non-linear relationships through predictor transformation, cross-validation approaches, and multi-factor ANOVA and ANCOVA. In terms of logistic regression, we’ll encounter models for binary outcomes, for proportions, and for risk adjustment. We’ll also touch on models for count data and multi-categorical outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2 number="3.2"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Taking 432 without 431 is not recommended. The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, in any field of study.</p>
<p>The main things students need for 432 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tools: substantive knowledge of the use of R, R Studio and R Markdown to produce code which will ingest, visualize, explore, analyze and model data, then communicate the results</li>
<li>statistical methodology: substantive understanding of statistical inference in the one-, two- and multi-sample cases and the fundamentals of linear regression models, including the building of multiple linear regressions, and their evaluation through diagnostic plots, stepwise model selection, assessment of uncertainty via confidence and prediction intervals, and basic in-sample and out-of sample validation summaries</li>
<li>data to study related to biological, health, medical, scientific or other phenomena, and</li>
<li>an interest in studying data closely and presenting rigorous analyses effectively</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these topics are reviewed in early 432 sessions.</p>

<li>The most important thing is the <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html">Course Calendar</a> which serves as the final word for all deadlines, plus links to all classes and deliverables.</li>
<li>Dr. Love’s course notes will serve as the principal textbook for the course, and will appear during the semester. The <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-432-book/">Spring 2020 version</a> is still online, if you want to see how the course changes from year to year.</li>

<h1 number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Getting Help with 432</h1>
<p>Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of frustration (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!). <strong>You shouldn’t spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help.</strong></p>
<p>Once the course begins, you have several ways to get help from us:</p>
<div id="ta-office-hours-provide-one-on-one-help" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2 number="4.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> TA Office hours provide one-on-one help</h2>
<p>We have eight dedicated and capable <a href="#teaching-assistants">Teaching Assistants</a> working with us this term. More <a href="#teaching-assistants">information on the TAs is available here</a>.</p>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to visit the Teaching Assistants during office hours that are convenient for you, whenever you need help with the course. This is the best way to get one-on-one help, or try out a new idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching Assistant (TA) office hours will be held via Zoom, starting after Class 02.
<ul>
<li>A detailed schedule will be provided in time for our first class.</li>
<li>Office Hours are held for your benefit. Please visit the TAs, especially if you have questions about how to do things in R, or about the content of the class slides or course notes.

<p>I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at Savant Systems, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder is a senior at the University of Pittsburgh who plans to be a paleontologist, and the younger is in his first year at Columbia University, my alma mater, although sadly he is doing it from home thanks to the pandemic. We live in Shaker Heights. In pre-pandemic times, I sang and acted occasionally in <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater">community theater</a>, and now I read plays occasionally over Zoom.</p>

<div id="professor-loves-materials" class="section level2" number="7.1">
<h2 number="7.1"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Professor Love’s Materials</h2>
<p>The main text is a set of Notes for the course, maintained by Professor Love, titled <strong>Data Science for Biological, Medical and Health Research: Notes for PQHS 432.</strong> A link to these notes will be made available to you at the first class. Professor Love revises the Notes every year, and so they will appear in fits and starts as the semester progresses.</p>
<p>Although these Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give 431 students a set of common materials on which to draw during the course, providing a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up during the semester, and in later work.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>slides</strong> and video recordings from each of Professor Love’s lectures, plus other in-class materials from each session of the class will be posted for your use in a timely fashion throughout the semester.</p>
<p>Once class begins, access all materials <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/432/">at the main course website</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned, we’ll read two books you’ll need to purchase:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Nate Silver’s <strong>The Signal and the Noise</strong>, available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/0143125087">on Amazon</a> for about $20.
<ul>
<li>The 2013 or 2015 edition is sufficient for 432, and either an electronic or paper version is fine. In 2020, Nate added a new preface, which is interesting, but not critical.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Jeff Leek’s <strong>How to be a Modern Scientist</strong> available as an ebook <a href="https://leanpub.com/modernscientist">on Leanpub</a> for a suggested $10 (minimum price: free).
<ul>
<li>This was written in 2016, and is thus a little out of date, but still very helpful. You can read the entire book in a couple of hours.</li>

<p>The remainder of this chapter comes from the 431 syllabus, and lays out some of the fundamental ideas and bits of encouragement I built for those folks this past Fall, and most of this is still relevant now.</p>
<p>The course makes heavy use of the R statistical programming language, and several related tools, most especially the RStudio development environment. Every bit of this software is free to use, and open-source.</p>
<p>You will need access to a computer to do your work for this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course.</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be many people in the course for whom R is a new experience. I assume no prior R work in the course. You will know a fair amount of R (and some other things, too) after taking the course, though.</li>
<li>We’ll also be using the R Markdown tool within RStudio. R Markdown will be taught in our class, and can be used to generate reproducible reports that appear as .html files, PDF files or Word documents, among other things.</li>
<li>For some people, working with R is the best part of the class, and the part that they’re most excited about.</li>
<li>For others, it’s a real source of anxiety. We understand and encourage patience. There will definitely be some pain, but our experience is that things are much smoother for most people by the middle of the term than they appear to be at the start.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="r-and-rstudio" class="section level2" number="9.3">
<h2 number="9.3"><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> R and RStudio</h2>
<p>You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org">programming language R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard. R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.</p>
<p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. Learning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham-the chief scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like <code>ggplot2</code> <a href="https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/">made this wise observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to the teaching assistants, post questions on Piazza, etc.</p>
<p>I promise you can do this.</p>
<p>Some of this material is also borrowed from Andrew Heiss, for instance, from <a href="https://evalf19.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus/">here</a> and <a href="https://econf20.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="system-requirements" class="section level2" number="9.4">
<h2 number="9.4"><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> System Requirements</h2>
<p>You will need access to a computer to do your work for this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. Whether or not you want to bring that computer to class is up to you. All of the software we will use in this class is either free and open source, or available to you for free through your affiliation with CWRU, so there is nothing to buy in terms of software.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve made some effort in terms of course requirements to set the bar low. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course.</li>
<li>You will need a computer, either PC (running Windows 10 would be helpful) or Macintosh (running a reasonably recent OS), but your choice should be determined by your personal preferences and how you believe you will use the machine in your research life. RStudio and R will look and work the same on either a PC or a Macintosh.</li>
<li>We <strong>do not</strong> recommend the use of a Chromebook for 431 or 432.</li>
<li>R and RStudio Desktop also run on Linux systems but Dr. Love knows essentially nothing about that. Consult the documentation <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">at CRAN for R</a> and <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">at the download page for RStudio</a>.</li>

<h2 number="9.5"><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Why do we teach R, instead of SPSS or SAS or whatever, in 431-432?</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Because it is by far the better choice for what we’re trying to do, which is to help you become effective data scientists. And effective scientists, period.</li>
<li>Because being a data scientist means writing code and actually doing (not just talking about) replicable research, which R facilitates in an immense variety of ways.</li>
<li>Because R is free to you, me and everyone, and its community is a daily delight.</li>
</ol>
<p>To read comments from other people on the subject, I suggest reading <a href="https://rbasics.netlify.com/2-whyr">Why R?</a> from Chester Ismay and Patrick Kennedy.</p>
<p>Also, the question of “Why R and not SPSS?” was nicely addressed by Greg Snow in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3787231/r-and-spss-difference">this 2010 post at StackOverflow</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When talking about user friendliness of computer software I like the analogy of cars vs. busses: Busses are very easy to use, you just need to know which bus to get on, where to get on, and where to get off (and you need to pay your fare). Cars on the other hand require much more work, you need to have some type of map or directions (even if the map is in your head), you need to put gas in every now and then, you need to know the rules of the road (have some type of drivers licence). The big advantage of the car is that it can take you a bunch of places that the bus does not go and it is quicker for some trips that would require transfering between busses. Using this analogy programs like SPSS are busses, easy to use for the standard things, but very frustrating if you want to do something that is not already preprogrammed. R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a kayak on top, good walking and running shoes in the passenger seat, and mountain climbing and spelunking gear in the back. R can take you anywhere you want to go if you take time to learn how to use the equipment, but that is going to take longer than learning where the bus stops are in SPSS.</p>

<div id="assignments-and-grading" class="section level1" number="10">
<h1 number="10"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Assignments and Grading</h1>
<p>Course assignments include (in increasing order of the time you will spend):</p>
<ul>
<li>Nine minute papers (along with other elements of class participation)</li>
<li>Six labs (five of which are required; the sixth is optional)</li>
<li>Two quizzes, and</li>
<li>Two projects</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/432/">course website</a> links to detailed and specific descriptions regarding each of these deliverables. This syllabus material describes each in general terms, and provides some guidance on logistics, expectations and grading.</p>
<div id="timing-and-deadlines" class="section level2" number="10.1">
<h2 number="10.1"><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Timing and Deadlines</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html">Calendar</a> is the exclusive home for all deadlines in the course. Dr. Love will always go there to figure out when something is due, and if a change is made, it isn’t official until it appears on the Calendar.</p>
</div>
<div id="minute-papers-and-class-participation" class="section level2" number="10.2">
<h2 number="10.2"><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Minute Papers (and Class Participation)</h2>
<p>During the semester, there are <strong>nine</strong> Minute Papers scheduled. In this class, a Minute Paper is a short survey (completed using a Google Form) where you will answer a few questions about how the course is going for you. To complete the Minute Paper, you’ll need to log into Google with your CWRU account. The pre-class <a href="#welcome-to-432-survey">“Welcome to 432” survey</a> uses a similar format, but is more extensive than a typical Minute Paper.</p>
<p>Each Minute Paper should take no more than ten minutes to complete, and is best done right at the end of Tuesday’s class. The Minute Papers are due at noon Wednesday to give you some time to reflect, if you’d like, or if you’re in a hurry at the end of Tuesday’s class.</p>
<p>Students who watch the class via video recording <strong>are still required</strong> to complete the Minute Paper in a timely fashion. You <strong>should</strong> complete the Minute Paper even if you haven’t yet viewed the most recent class.</p>
<div id="grading-class-participation" class="section level3" number="10.2.1">
<h3 number="10.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">10.2.1</span> Grading Class Participation</h3>
<p>Only Professor Love sees the results of the Minute Papers with identifying information. He then summarizes findings without identifying people and addresses those in the Thursday class whenever possible.</p>
<p>Student Class Participation grades are determined by Dr. Love out of a maximum of 100 points. This determination is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 points for completing the <a href="#welcome-to-432-survey">“Welcome to 432” survey</a> that most of you did prior to class, and if you haven’t done it, please do so now.</li>
<li>plus up to 45 additional points for Minute Paper responses (5 points for each on-time submission)</li>
<li>plus up to 30 bonus points for actions that help the class, as awarded during the semester</li>
</ul>
<p>These bonus points have a small impact, generally, but include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>finding typographical or coding errors in Professor Love’s slides, notes and other published materials.</li>
<li>asking especially helpful questions in the Minute Papers, in TA office hours, before or after class with Dr. Love or on <a href="https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432">Piazza</a></li>
<li>providing helpful responses to questions on <a href="https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432">Piazza</a></li>
<li>identifying interesting visualizations or uses of ideas we’re discussing in class in the popular or scientific media (this is also done via <a href="https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432">Piazza</a>)</li>
<li>plus a few other things that come under the general heading of “being helpful.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the bonus, scores up to 105 / 100 in Class Participation are technically possible, although almost everyone in fact will fall in the range of 70 - 100 points. Bonus credit is capped so that no one’s class participation score exceeds 105 points.</p>

<div id="labs" class="section level2" number="10.3">
<h2 number="10.3"><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Labs</h2>
<p>During the semester, there are <strong>six</strong> lab assignments scheduled, the first five of which are required, while the sixth is optional. Professor Love reserves the right to change the number of labs depending on how the class is going during the semester.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most require straightforward demonstrations of mastery for core principles and fundamental skills. Some require deeper dives into more technically sophisticated material.</li>
<li>Most labs ask you to clean/visualize/analyze some data that we provide to you, and also to react to something we’re reading at the same time in the Silver or Leek books.</li>
<li>You should anticipate that some coding in R <strong>and</strong> writing at least one essay will be required in most labs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each lab includes instructions as to how to make your submission, usually through <a href="https://canvas.case.edu">Canvas</a>. The course’s primary listing on Canvas is PQHS 432, but students in CRSP 432 and MPHP 432 should find the same information. The link to post your responses for each Lab will appear in time for you to submit the work, usually just after the deadline for the preceding Lab has passed.</p>
<p>Each lab is associated with a deadline. Late work is permitted, but penalized (see the Grading section below.)</p>

<h3 number="10.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">10.3.1</span> A few tips for Early Lab Work</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When writing anything for this course in English, use complete sentences, not just bullet points.</li>
<li>Clearly mark each Question in each Lab. There is no need to repeat the question before answering it, although you are welcome to do so.</li>
<li>You are welcome to discuss each Lab with anyone, including Professor Love, the teaching assistants, or your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. We especially encourage you to take advantage of TA office hours and <a href="https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432">Piazza</a>.</li>
<li>In general, we do not guarantee to provide answers to questions that we receive in the last 12 hours before a Lab is due, although we will continue to hold TA office hours up to the deadline. Try not to leave things until the last day. Allow time for computer problems.</li>

</div>
<div id="grading-labs" class="section level3" number="10.3.2">
<h3 number="10.3.2"><span class="header-section-number">10.3.2</span> Grading Labs</h3>
<p>Labs are graded by the Teaching Assistants, according to a rubric and answer sketch, developed by the instructional staff for the course, including Dr. Love. Everything counts, including the quality of the presentation, as well as the coding and statistical work.</p>
<p>For each Lab, we publish a detailed answer sketch (typically at noon on the day after the deadline). By the time grades become available (roughly one week after the deadline) you will also receive the grading rubric, though we sometimes include this with the sketch. Along with the grade, on-time labs will receive modest feedback about the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>The five required labs are each due on Mondays at 9 PM Eastern time, as described in the <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html">Calendar</a>.</li>
<li>Labs received <strong>on time</strong> can receive up to 100% of the available points for the lab. We do not penalize lab work received within one hour of the deadline (so, by Monday at 10 PM Eastern.)</li>
<li>Labs received more than one hour after the deadline but before noon on the following day (Tuesday) will receive a late penalty of 10% of available points on the lab.</li>
<li>Lab submissions received after the answer sketch is published at noon Tuesday but within one week of the deadline will receive a late penalty of 25% of available points.</li>
<li>Lab submissions received more than one week after the deadline will not be graded.</li>

<div id="creating-a-lab-grade" class="section level2" number="10.4">
<h2 number="10.4"><span class="header-section-number">10.4</span> Creating a Lab Grade</h2>
<p>To calculate your lab grade, Dr. Love will use the four labs (out of the first five) on which you have the highest score, dropping the lab with the lowest score. The remaining four labs are weighted equally in determining your lab grade.</p>
<ul>
<li>This means you can skip one of the first five labs during the semester without penalty.</li>
<li>If you decide to skip a lab, please submit a note to Canvas by the lab’s deadline indicating that you are skipping the lab, so that we don’t hound you to submit it.</li>
<li>Should you run the risk of needing to miss more than one of the first five labs during the semester, follow <a href="#in-case-of-emergency">the emergency policy</a> and contact Dr. Love via email.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sixth lab is optional, and is graded differently, as is described in the instructions for Lab 06.</p>
<div id="appeal-policy---request-a-review-in-may" class="section level3" number="10.4.1">
<h3 number="10.4.1"><span class="header-section-number">10.4.1</span> Appeal Policy - Request a Review in May!</h3>
<p>Clarification of concerns related to potential typographical or other errors in our Lab answer sketches is welcome at any time, but haggling over points on assignments can be a real time sink in a large class. To that end, students are <strong>requested not to dispute</strong> any grading on Labs during the semester, but instead to request a review using a Google Form to be opened by Professor Love in May.</p>
<p>Should you receive a lower grade on a Lab than you feel you deserve based on the feedback the TA provides, the answer sketch and the grading rubric, you can submit a request for a regrade by Professor Love by submitting a request through a Google Form he will provide to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/labs">course Labs page</a>, we include a section about Grading Errors and Regrade Requests. There, you’ll find a link to a Google form (you must log into Google via CWRU to see it) listing all of the Labs. Any student who wishes to dispute points can specify the number of points in question for each item, and the details of the issues that concern them.
<ul>
<li>If you wish to dispute a grade, fill out the form at any time before the deadline in May. You can edit the form after submitting it so that you can add additional requests up until the end of the semester.</li>
<li>All forms must be submitted by the deadline in December specified on the Course Calendar.</li>
<li>Disputing a grade on a homework with a teaching assistant is pointless.</li>
<li>Professor Love is responsible for all final grading decisions, and if you have a concern, you should submit your request through the form.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Students are welcome to ask questions of Professor Love about grading during the term. The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term.
- The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Love’s attention via email, and such problems will be corrected immediately.</p>
<p>In mid-May, <strong>after</strong> Professor Love has worked out what letter grade to give each student, he will go through the requests on the form and determine for each whether the student’s letter grade would change if all of the points in dispute were granted. If the answer is no, then he won’t even look at the disputed grade(s). If the answer is yes, then he will look very carefully to see if enough extra points are merited to change a grade. (It will not help your case to submit frivolous requests.)</p>
<p>The main advantage of this system is that it saves all of us the hassle of haggling over points that are never going to mean anything anyway. It also provides “equal access” to students who are too timid to express their concerns. Finally, if there is an issue with grading a particular problem or assignment that needs to be reconsidered, Professor Love will have access to all papers and can make a universal decision. Incidentally, this idea comes from Jessica Utts at <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v22n2/rossmanint.pdf" class="uri">http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v22n2/rossmanint.pdf</a>.</p>

Each quiz is taken online via a Google Form (like the Minute Papers or the <a href="#welcome-to-432-survey">“Welcome to 432” survey</a>.) Each quiz includes both short-answer and multiple-choice items. The quizzes focus on whether you can apply the tools developed in class to address small problems.</p>
<p>You will receive access to the quiz more than a week before it is due, and each quiz will be designed to take about 6 hours to complete, so the time pressure should be minimal. <strong>If you need to make alternate arrangements for a Quiz, please contact Professor Love via email as soon as possible</strong>, at least a week before a Quiz is released.</p>

<p>In calculating your project average for your course grade, I will weight Project 1 at 40% and Project 2 at 60%.</p>
<p>Students who cannot complete a project (either 1 or 2) in a timely fashion will receive an incomplete grade until both Projects are completed. A penalty will be applied to late work on projects.</p>
<p>Once the complete project instructions are available, please contact Dr. Love directly if you are in any way concerned about your ability to complete a project on time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="final-grade" class="section level2" number="10.7">
<h2 number="10.7"><span class="header-section-number">10.7</span> Final Grade</h2>
<p>Over the past five years, all students taking the course have eventually earned either an “A”, a “B” or an “Incomplete” in 432. I don’t see a reason why this won’t also be the case this year.</p>
<p>Grading standards apply in the same way for all students, regardless of whether they are enrolled in PQHS 432, CRSP 432 or MPHP 432. The courses are identical.</p>
<p>The course grade is based on four key areas of demonstrated accomplishment.</p>
<p>Course grades are based primarily on performance on labs, projects and quizzes. Your grade on each of these three elements will be determined separately. Then I will combine these elements as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Element</th>
<th>Weight 1</th>
<th>Weight 2</th>
<th>Weight 3</th>
<th>Weight 4</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Labs</td>
<td>35%</td>
<td>30%</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Projects</td>
<td>45%</td>
<td>40%</td>
<td>35%</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Quizzes</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>20%</td>
<td>15%</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Participation</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Among Labs, Projects and Quizzes, your element with the strongest score will receive Weight 1, your element with the second strongest score will receive Weight 2 and your element with the weakest score will receive weight 3. The Class Participation score is worth 10% for all students.</p>
<p>I will determine your final course grade using the following scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>course averages of 89% to 100% will receive a A</li>
<li>course averages of 85% to 88% will be reviewed more closely to determine whether the grade will be A or B</li>
<li>course averages of 70% to 84% will receive a B</li>
</ul>
<p>For students in the 85-88% range, students who have improved from the first half of the course to the second will be more likely to receive an A than those whose performance has declined.</p>
<p>Students whose course average is near or below 70% will usually need to take an Incomplete to improve their work before I assign a final grade.</p>

<div id="course-policies" class="section level1" number="11">
<h1 number="11"><span class="header-section-number">11</span> Course Policies</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Any concerns or questions regarding these general policies, the teaching assistants or the course itself should be directed to Professor Love, if at all possible.</li>
<li>All student work is subject to the University’s policies and procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Registration is required</strong>. I do not permit anyone to audit the course who has not previously taken it, without exception. If you’ve taken the course before and want to sit in again, you will need to volunteer or be hired as a teaching assistant.</li>
<li><strong>Grading</strong>. Students in this class are not in competition with each other for grades. I have no set percentage of students who will receive any particular grade.</li>
<li><strong>Attendance</strong> is expected, but it is also expected that sometimes life will intervene. All students are expected to view all Zoom class sessions, preferably as they happen live, but if necessary, using the video recordings made available on Canvas to view each class before the next one is given.
<ul>
<li>If you need to miss two or more classes in a row, inform Professor Love via email beforehand, or as soon as possible thereafter. I will assume you have a good reason - details are <strong>not</strong> necessary.</li>
<li>You are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for your absence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Submissions</strong> In this class, it is far better to turn in timely, but only partially complete work than nothing at all.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback on assignments - deadline.</strong> On every assignment, Lab, Quiz, project-related task, whatever, we will be delighted to respond to questions <strong>up to 12 hours before</strong> the assignment is due. After that time, you may wind up on your own. The reason for this is that Professor Love and the teaching assistants will regularly post responses to frequently asked questions about assignments, and we need sufficient time to accomplish this task.</li>
<li><strong>On Getting Help Quickly and Effectively</strong>: In general, we don’t have a way to diagnose your problem with R, RStudio or Markdown if you don’t show us what you’re typing that causes an error, or a lack of results. If you wrote a Markdown file, we need to see it, along with a specific question (or series of them) about specific error messages or strange results you are getting. We need to replicate the problem in order to know how to fix your problem, and it also helps if we know what error message you’re seeing, or what strange result you are getting.</li>
<li><strong>Distractions</strong>. Please mute yourself during a Zoom class, unless you are asking a question, or working in a small group. We strongly prefer people to turn on their cameras, but do not requir this. The temptation to look at your phone or Facebook or email during class is nearly irresistible. Resist anyway, if only to avoid distracting your instructor and your fellow students.</li>
<li><strong>Research Usage</strong>. Any and all results of in-class and out-of-class assignments and activities are data sources for research and may be used in published research. All such use will always be anonymous.</li>
<li><strong>Recording.</strong> We intend to provide video recordings of each class after they are complete. You should assume that anything you say or place in the Chat session during a Zoom class session <em>will</em> be recorded.</li>
<li><strong>Typos.</strong> Professor Love makes occasional typographic and grammatical errors, which irritate him enormously. Please post in the relevant section of <a href="https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432">Piazza</a> if you find any in this syllabus or any other course materials. If you are the first to let us know, and we make the change, you will receive some credit in your class participation grade.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, all Case Western Reserve University policies apply to this class. To the extent that those policies are unclear, I would regard an appropriate code of conduct as mirroring <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/RCDI-WG/blob/master/conduct/code-of-conduct.md">this one from the R Consortium</a>.</p>

<h1 number="13"><span class="header-section-number">13</span> On Writing, Presenting &amp; Communicating</h1>
<p>I write all the time. It’s my job. It’s yours, too. You’ll do more of it here than you may be expecting in this class, and in life. So you’ll need to take advantage of every opportunity you have to write more effectively tomorrow than you do today.</p>
<p>Here’s what I find to be a compelling argument from George Cobb …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want your work with data to make a difference, devote time and effort to choosing the words and pictures you use to present your evidence and conclusions. If you teach or supervise, seek to reward those - they who learn from you, and they who report to you – when they spend time crafting their message.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think back to the last “report” you were expected to read. Is it easy to recall the main points? The answer, yes or no, depends not so much on the quality of the data, the effort, and the thinking that went into the report, nor on your own dutiful diligence in reading the report, but rather, and mainly, on whether the people who wrote the report had learned and practiced the skills of how to use words and pictures, first, to claim attention, and second, to claim retention: to deliver a message that sticks in the mind.</p>

<h2 number="13.3"><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> A Few Tips from Professor Love</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Statistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7.</li>
<li>Nothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables.</li>
<li>Don’t parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism.</li>
<li>Edit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results.</li>
<li>Make your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary.</li>
<li>Clearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate.</li>
<li>Simplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well.</li>
<li>Data are plural. Use “the data <strong>are</strong> …” rather than ``the data <em>is</em> … ’’</li>
<li>A paragraph must contain more than one sentence.<br />
</li>
<li>Don’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout.</li>
<li>Don’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result.</li>
<li>Similarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in.</li>
<li>If you want to write that you used <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval.<br />
</li>
<li>If you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a <em>p</em>-value, then you should state something like:
<ul>
<li>[1] We’re using a 95% confidence level.</li>
<li>[2] We’re using a 5% significance level.<br />
</li>
<li>[3] We’re using <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>.<br />
</li>
<li>Don’t use more than one of these expressions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Again, don’t use <em>p</em>-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all <em>p</em>-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.001\)</span>, rather than, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.00000001\)</span> or, worse yet, <span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span>. In a similar vein, write all <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values that exceed 0.99 as <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.99\)</span> instead of, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(p = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>To the extent possible, don’t use <code>computer-ese</code> to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage.</li>
<li>When in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking, clear writing.</li>

<li>If you’d prefer to share a serial program from a streaming service, that is also fine. What we’re looking for is something we can watch that has multiple episodes. We intend to share the list of selected programs with the class, not identifying which student liked which program.</li>
