# Getting Started

## Before our First Class

Most of you have already accessed [the pre-class website](https://431-2020-preclass-love.netlify.app/). Once class begins, that will no longer be relevant, and will be replaced by [our main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/) and (among other things) this Syllabus. If you're seeing this before class starts on 2020-08-25, then make sure that you:

1. Register and enroll in the course via the [CWRU Student Information System (SIS)](https://sis.case.edu/).
    - Note that PQHS 431, CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 are all identical.
2. Review [the pre-class website](https://431-2020-preclass-love.netlify.app/) and this syllabus. The most important needs initially are learning [about the books][Required Texts] you'll need to purchase, and [the software][Getting the Software] you'll need to install. 
3. Review [CWRU's Knowledge Base for Zoom](https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information) to ensure you can join our first class through your CWRU Zoom account. Watch your CWRU email for further bulletins (including the Zoom links for the first few class sessions which will be posted on 2020-08-24.)

## What Do I Need To Buy?

We'll read two books that you need to purchase (combined price is \$18 to \$33):

- David Spiegelhater *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data*, published in the US by Basic Books in 2019, available [at Amazon, for instance](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513), for around \$18 (Kindle) or \$23 (hardcover). The US and UK versions are identical other than the cover and subtitle.
- Jeffrey Leek, *The Elements of Data Analytic Style*, available at https://leanpub.com/datastyle (minimum price is free, suggested price is $10).

Everything else is free, and is described in detail in the rest of this syllabus or on the course website.

## "Welcome to 431" Survey 

Most of you did this before class started, but if you haven't, please fill out the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-survey) at https://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-survey to help us get to know you a little better.

- Note that you must **log into Google via your CWRU account** in order to access the survey.
- The survey should take 15-20 minutes to complete, and we encourage you to complete it as soon as you can.
