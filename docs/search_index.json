"],["course-description.html", "Section 1 Course Description 1.1 General Approach / Topics 1.2 Prerequisites 1.3 Everything is on the Web", " Section 1 Course Description PQHS 432 (cross-listed as CRSP 432 and MPHP 432, and formerly known as EPBI 432) is the second half of a two-semester sequence (with PQHS 431) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent (as little theory as possible), emphasizing the key role of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research. The title listed by the registrar is a little dated - I prefer Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research. This is a good course for people who want to learn how to use the R language to get information from data, and who want to learn about making comparisons and building models to help make meaningful progress in research, focusing on questions from biology, medicine and public health. We spend time managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other things thought of as data science - in essence, this highly applied course focuses on modern, more than classical, tools for learning from data. The course is taught using the R statistical software and RStudio environments, with the material discussed in 431 assumed in 432. Students learned a lot of R in the 431 course, and that material remains available at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431. Well continue to use R Studio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform our research in replicable ways. 1.1 General Approach / Topics The course covers the following general topics, roughly in this order, through early April. Additional topics (for the remainder of April) will be determined later in the semester. Linear Regression (including weighted and robust approaches, variable selection, dealing with missing data, fitting non-linear relationships through predictor transformation, cross-validation approaches, and multi-factor ANOVA and ANCOVA) Logistic Regression (including both models for binary outcomes, and models for proportions, and risk adjustment) Generalized Linear Models (including regression models for count data, multi-categorical outcomes) The Statistical Crisis in Science Cluster Analysis (mostly in the form of Principal Components Analysis) Survival Analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox Regression) 1.2 Prerequisites Taking 432 without 431 is not recommended. The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, in any field of study. The main things students need for 432 are: tools: substantive knowledge of the use of R, R Studio and R Markdown to produce code which will ingest, visualize, explore, analyze and model data, then communicate the results statistical methodology: substantive understanding of statistical inference in the one-, two- and multi-sample cases and the fundamentals of linear regression models, including the building of multiple linear regressions, and their evaluation through diagnostic plots, stepwise model selection, assessment of uncertainty via confidence and prediction intervals, and basic in-sample and out-of sample validation summaries data to study related to biological, health, medical, scientific or other phenomena, and an interest in studying data closely and presenting rigorous analyses effectively Some of these topics are reviewed in early 432 sessions. 1.3 Everything is on the Web https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432 is the place to go for everything related to this course. Please visit any time you need something. I update the web site frequently. The most important thing is the Course Calendar which serves as the final word for all deadlines, plus links to all classes and deliverables. Dr. Loves book of 432 Course Notes is the principal textbook for the course, and will appear during the semester. The Spring 2019 version is available now. Additional details will be coming soon.

Life is not OK right now. None of us are really okay. Were all just pretending. You most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased care responsibilities - you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you might be facing uncertain job prospects. Im fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your labs, do well on your quizzes and projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am fairly flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified. If you tell me youre having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope youll extend me the same grace. You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that youre going through, though. If I cant help you myself, I may know somebody who can. If you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like youre behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to us! We will work with you. I promise. I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis. Thanks to Andrew Heiss for a lot of the better words here. 3.1 What if I get sick, or have to care for someone who is sick once the semester starts? If you need to miss one session, or even two, just review the materials (including the recordings) and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help. 3.1.1 IN CASE OF EMERGENCY If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of work that has a deadline, like a lab, minute paper, or the like, send an email directly to Dr. Love saying the following: I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (list things youre worried about completing) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans. Dr. Love will respond with OK and temporarily excuse you from things until you send a re-connection email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time hell evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency.

Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of frustration (even if youve been doing this stuff for years!). You shouldnt spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help. Once the course begins, you have several ways to get help from us: 4.1 Piazza is the place to ask questions We will use Piazza this semester to facilitate questions and answers. Well be conducting all class-related discussion there, instead of via email. Find our class page at: https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431/home. If youre successfully enrolled in the class, you should be able to sign up immediately. The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker youll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when youre struggling to understand anything related to the class, and you can even do so anonymously. Youll also be able to help your colleagues by answering their questions, as well. We will use Piazza for all questions except questions about Quizzes. Details on the plan for Quizzes follow in the Quizzes section below. In addition, there are many, many online resources to help you learn R beyond those we provide. Googling effectively is an important skill that requires practice. Dont be afraid to use search engines to figure out how to code things in R, for example. The RStudio Community is a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (and that will be you.) 4.2 Virtual TA Office hours provide one-on-one help You are strongly encouraged to visit TAs during office hours that are convenient for you, whenever you need help with the course. This is the best way to get one-on-one help, or try out a new idea. - Teaching Assistant (TA) office hours will be held via Zoom, beginning 2020-08-31. - A schedule is now available on Canvas (in the Announcements folder.) - Office Hours are held for your benefit. Please visit the TAs, especially if you have questions about how to do things in R, or about the content of the class slides or course notes. Theyre volunteering their time to help you, and most of them have been in your shoes in previous years. They want to help you! - More information on the TAs is posted below. 4.3 Meeting with Professor Love Professor Love does not hold regular office hours. He will open Zoom 15 minutes before each class, and keep it open afterwards, as well, to address any student concerns that youre willing to discuss there. If you have any unique concerns about the course, need special accommodations or have any other issues you want to discuss with Professor Love specifically, please email him (Thomas dot Love at case dot edu) and hell respond as quickly as possible. Remember that questions about course materials are best asked through Piazza or at TA Office Hours.

I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs. I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics. I direct Biostatistics and Evaluation at the Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy, which is a joint venture of CWRU and MetroHealth Medical Center. For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for Better Health Partnership, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there. I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching from CWRU. I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management. In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records. You may be interested in a recent study in Health Affairs showing the impact of a Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland. Or you might be interested in our New England Journal of Medicine study of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes. In 2011, James OMalley and I chaired the Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics, here in Cleveland. Heres a recap. Ive also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure. If you want to see a pretty complete list of my publications, knock yourself out. I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at GE Lighting, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder is a junior in college (University of Pittsburgh) who plans to be a paleontologist, and one finishing high school this year, who will attend Columbia this Fall. I live in Shaker Heights. I also sing and act occasionally in community theater. 5.2 Email Email to get help with the course: 431-help at case dot edu (seen by Professor Love and the TAs) Thomas dot Love at case dot edu (for matters related to grades or individual concerns) Professor Love is hard to reach by phone. Email is always the best way to reach him. 5.3 Offices Wood WG-82J on the ground floor of the Wood building (Tuesdays and Thursdays) Rammelkamp R-229A at MetroHealth Medical Center (Wednesdays and Fridays) Professor Love is available for the 15 minutes before and the 30 minutes after each class, and otherwise by appointment on Tuesdays and Thursdays (send email to schedule). 5.4 Name and Pronouns Professor Love uses he/him/his pronouns. Most students refer to him either as Professor Love or Dr. Love. He prefers his given name to be written Thomas as opposed to Tom. Most of his friends and colleagues call him Tom. You are welcome to do so, as well, if that makes you more comfortable. 5.5 Web Professor Loves GitHub pages website. His GitHub name is THOMASELOVE. His Twitter handle is ThomasELove.

Stephanies research focuses on the relationship of early life nutrition interventions and long-term growth and developmental outcomes in very low birthweight infants. While Stephanie changed her undergraduate major to avoid a class with a programming requirement, she has immensely enjoyed learning R in 431 and 432. Stephanie has been using her R skills to create a database to assess nutrition-related outcomes for preterm infants in MetroHealths NICU. In the pre-pandemic era, Stephanie enjoyed rowing, traveling, and attending concerts. Now, she spends her time hiking with her dog and making pasta. Claudia Cabrera Claudia Cabrera is an International Medical Graduate from Mexico. On 2019 she graduated from CWRUs MS Program in Clinical Research. Before coming to Case, Claudia worked in Bariatric Surgery for two years while also lecturing in Anatomy and Physiology at the same university from which she graduated in Mexico. She took 431 and 432 and TAd for them during her MS program and thoroughly enjoyed learning Statistics, especially its applications to medicine. She is now in her second year as a Biomedical and Health Informatics PhD student at CWRU. Her area of research is otolaryngology - head and neck cancer using big data. In her free time, Claudia loves to explore Cleveland, especially by running and biking, and she also loves playing basketball and reading. Lauren Cruz Lauren Cruz is a first year student in the PhD epidemiology and biostatistics program. She earned her MPH with a focus in population health at CWRU in Spring 2020. Lauren has a background in biological anthropology and is interested in genetic epidemiology and evolutionary development. When shes not studying, you can likely find her cooking, gardening, or cycling. As part of her Masters culminating experience, Lauren worked with Dr. Love through Better Health Partnership to evaluate a community healthcare outreach program involving a diverse patient population. She took 431/432 last cycle and is eager to work with this years cohort to explore different ways to approach the key statistical concepts taught in this course series. Daoyu Duan Daoyu Duan is a 1st year PhD student in Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics. I got my Bachelor degree in Math&amp;Stats from UIUC and MS degree in Biostatistics from Columbia University. Before coming to CWRU, I have been working in a Pharmaceutical company called Regeneron for 2 years. My current research interest is sequencing data analysis. I enjoy video games, cooking and swimming most of the time. Guanqun (Leslie) Meng Leslie (Guanqun) Meng is a first year PhD student Epidemiology/Biostatistics program. He received his M.S degree in Biostatistics from Yale University in May 2020.

Nothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables. Dont parrot back material that Dr. Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in other words is, technically, plagiarism. Edit your more adventurous output; dont present everything you know how to do in R, and dont forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results. Make your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary. Clearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate. Simplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well. Data are plural. Use the data are  rather than ``the data is   A paragraph must contain more than one sentence. Dont switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout. Dont write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result. Similarly, dont defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in. If you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval. If youre looking at a p-value, then you should state either: [1] Were using a 95% confidence level. [2] Were using a 5% significance level. or [3] Were using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Dont use more than one of these expressions. Refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p = 1\\). To the extent possible, dont use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things  do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage. Use words that we all know, whenever possible, and provide clear definitions at the first encounter when jargon is mandatory. Often the most useful thing you can do in an analysis is to turn a table into a meaningful graph. When in doubt, err on the side of clearer expression. Clear thinking causes and is demonstrated by clear writing. In the words of Edward Tufte, to think clearly, keep asking yourself  "]]
