# One More Thing

Once you have read through to this point in the Syllabus, please e-mail Professor Love an image from one of your favorite television programs, along with the name of the program, and a sentence or two about why you enjoy (or have enjoyed) that program. 

- If you'd prefer to share a serial program from a streaming service, that is also fine. What we're looking for is something we can watch that has multiple episodes. We intend to share the list of selected programs with the class, not identifying which student liked which program.

If Dr. Love receives this information from you before the start of Class 03, he will add some bonus credit to your class participation grade, and he will also be very grateful.

Thank you.
